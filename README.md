# MultiStatic-SONAR-Archetype
Strengthening our defence system has become one of the major concerns in today's era. Taking navy into consideration, submarines and ships are still using traditional monostatic sonars for underwater detection which has a major issue issue of limited range. 

The limited range of Mono-static sonar systems, caused by factors such as signal attenuation and absorption in seawater, has historically constrained our abilitytoobtain output. Recognizing the necessity for a breakthrough in sonar technology, researchers and engineers have turned their attention toward Multi-static sonar systems as a promising solution. The term ‘Multi-static’ indicates that multiple transmitter-receiver pairs areusedfor target detection, which are spatially distributed to work together toperformsensing and imaging tasks.

This project is cost freindly achitechtural reference to multistatic SONAR using Ultrasonic sensor instead of underwater sensor  which can be further implemented using hydrophones/sonar sensors to work inside water.
